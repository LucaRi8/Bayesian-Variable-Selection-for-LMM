# Bayesian-Variable-Selection-for-LMM

- Gibbs_spike_slab.R is an implementation of a gibbs sampler for a linear mixed model with spike and slab prior on fixed effects. The aim
  of the model is to do BVS on fixed effect conditionally to the random effects.

- Reversible_jump.R is an implementation of reversible jump algotithm for linear model with spike and slab prior on beta parameters.
